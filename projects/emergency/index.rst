Emergency Amp
=============

Built into retrofitted chassis from some kind of old radio equipment, with the 
dynamo label: "For emergency use only."

Possible parts:

* Bayonet Indicators: http://www.turretboards.com/lamps_lenses.htm
  Fits holes already in chassis for same.  Potentially still have one that could
  work, need another one.

* Small Push-Pull output transformer: http://www.edcorusa.com/p/390/gxpp10-8-8k
  Good for a pair of 6V6s, small footprint.

* Power transformer: Hammond 269AX, same as SE-1.
 
* Pair of Sovtek 7591XYZ for output tubes, supposedly just rebased 6L6s.

* 6948 submini tube (for guided missiles!) as preamp tube.

* 5703 submini tube for split load phase inverter

* heater current for 6V6 tubes 0.45A + 0.45A + 0.35A + 0.2A = 1.45A, which 
  is under the 2A spec for the PT.

* Filter caps: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/United-Chemi-Con/EKXG451ELL470MM25S/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtZ1n0r9vR22aQH5xX%252bZwq9jzBDt5IPqmU%3d
